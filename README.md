# Customer-Spend-Estimate
The aim of this project estimating customer's spend by using multiple linear regression.

The dataset was created by chatGPT for educational purposes.

The dataset contains the following variables for each customer:

•	Independent variables:

1. The population of the city where the customer lives (thousands of people)
2. Total expenditure made by the customer in the last year (TL)
3. Number of customer clicks on internet ads
4. Average time spent by the customer on the website (minutes)

•	The dependent variable:

1. Customer's spending amount (TL)

In this data set, our dependent variable is the Amount of Expenditure, and our independent variables are all other variables.
In other words, we will examine the amount of customer spending that varies depending on City Population, Total Spend, Ad Clicks and average time spent on the Internet. To examine this with multiple linear regression, our dataset has to provide some assumptions. These assumptions are as follows.

ASSUMPTIONS
• Linear Relationship Assumption
• Assumption of Independence
• Normality Assumption

To examine the linear relationship assumption, we can look at the scatter-plot plots of the dependent variable with each independent variable and see if it is in a linear relationship.
For the independence assumption, we will examine the correlation between the independent variables. The correlation shows the relationship between two variables and the strength of this relationship. If there is a very strong relationship between the two independent variables, this will break our assumption.
